## System Architecture

### Core Entities

1. **Article**: Slipper models with cost breakdowns
   - Name, cutting cost, printing cost, stitching cost, selling price

2. **Plan**: Production orders
   - Article, color, size-quantity pairs, vendors, status tracking
   - Progress through: Pending_Cutting ‚Üí Cutting ‚Üí Pending_Printing ‚Üí Printing ‚Üí Pending_Stitching ‚Üí Stitching ‚Üí Completed

3. **Vendor**: Service providers
   - Roles: Cutting, Printing, Stitching
   - Payment tracking and history

4. **Stock**: Inventory management
   - UpperStock: After cutting/stitching, before machine
   - FinishedStock: After machine processing
   - StockMovementRequest: Track all movements

### Key Workflows

#### Plan Creation and Execution
1. Create plan with article, color, and size-quantity specifications
2. Assign vendors for cutting, printing, and stitching
3. Move plan through statuses as work progresses
4. Record final quantities during cutting
5. Send to machine processing (moves stock from upper to finished)

#### Stock Management
1. Upper stock created when cutting is completed
2. Stock moved to finished when sent to machine
3. All movements tracked with timestamps and quantities

#### Vendor Payment Management
1. Payment amounts calculated based on quantities and article costs
2. Payments recorded when tasks are completed
3. Comprehensive payment history and reporting
